=============== introduction =============== 

This is a small Brainfuck interpreter written in Python.

Usage:
 ./brainfuck.py yourcode.bf

You can use it as a module as well:
  import brainfuck

  sourcecode = """
    ++++++++++[>+++++++>++++++++++>+++>+<<<<-]
    >++.>+.+++++++..+++.>++.<<+++++++++++++++.
    >.+++.------.--------.>+.>.
  """

  brainfuck.evaluate(sourcecode)

==================== what is brainfuck? ====================

Brainfuck is an esoteric programming language created in 1993 by Urban MÃ¼ller, and is notable for its extreme minimalism.

The language consists of only eight simple commands and an instruction pointer. While it is fully Turing complete,
it is not intended for practical use, but to challenge and amuse programmers. Brainfuck simply requires one to
break commands into microscopic steps.

The language's name is a reference to the slang term brainfuck, which refers to things so complicated or unusual 
that they exceed the limits of one's understanding.


========================= brainfuck commands =========================

>	increment pointer
<	decrement pointer
+	increment value at pointer
-	decrement value at pointer
[	begin loop (continues while value at pointer is non-zero)
]	end loop
,	read one character from input into value at pointer
.	print value at pointer to output as a character
#	display debugging info (in debug mode)
Any other characters are ignored.
